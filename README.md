# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
  This analysis sought to organize ride-sharing information by city type and display data in a line chart to summarize the total fares for each city type.
  
## Results

  From the summary data frame we can see that Urban city types have significantly more Total Rides, Total Drivers, and Total Fares.  However, Rural city types have the largest Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver.  Suburban city types were not the largest or smallest for any of these categories.

 When comparing the Total Fares by City Type we can see that Urban fares are consistently the highest and Rural fares are the lowest.  All three city types saw a spike in fare prices near the end of February.

## Summary
  After reviewing the summary information three recommendations can be made. Increasing the number of drivers in Rural and Suburban city types could help to drive down the cost of fares for Rural and Suburban riders.  Increasing drivers could also help to increase Total Rides and therefore Total Fares. Finally, the sharp increase of fares in all three city types should be investigated in late February to see the cause and offer promos to riders during peak times in order to encourage ridership with consistent fares.
